    Simon is a Frontend Developer who values clean, clear code, test-driven
    development (TDD), and browser applications that deliver robust
    functionality with an intuitive user experience (UX).
  </p>
  <p>
    While not coding, you're most likely to find Simon... well, sleeping - which
    is how he tries to spend a third of his life. But if you catch him awake,
    you'll likely find him cooking, running, wine tasting, strength training,
    reflecting, or spending quality times with friends. And if you and he are
    both very lucky, he'll be involved in more than one of the above at once.
  </p>
  <p>... Some combinations work better than others.</p>
